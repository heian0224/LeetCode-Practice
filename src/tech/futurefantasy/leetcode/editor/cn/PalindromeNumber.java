/**
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.


 Example 1:


Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


 Example 2:


Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 1
21-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


 Example 3:


Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.



 Constraints:


 -2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1



Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
